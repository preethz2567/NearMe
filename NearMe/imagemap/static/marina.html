        <li>Marine Life and Conservation Efforts
        Marina Beach is not only a tourist attraction but also an important site for marine life, particularly for sea turtles. The beach serves as a nesting ground for the endangered Olive Ridley sea turtles, and efforts have been made by local organizations to protect these creatures. While the beach faces challenges from urbanization, pollution, and coastal erosion, conservation efforts are being implemented to preserve its natural ecosystem.
